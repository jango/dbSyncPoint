dbSyncPoint
===========

dbSyncPoint is a demo project showing how to use a SQL Server database to synchronize multiple copies of an app running on different machines to perform a simultaneous action. The motivation for this example was to simulate a simultaneous user scenario in a performance testing project. More information can be found in this [blog post](http://pchelin.ca/2014/06/17/sync-points/).
